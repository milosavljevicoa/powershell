# Windows Powershell

Here are some of mine powershell modules.

To use this repo you have to install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

## Available commands

- `Get-ChtSh` (or for shorter `cht-sh`) - calls [cht.sh](https://cht.sh`) with `:learn`
for the following `go, docker, lua, git, python`
- `Set-FzfLocation` (or for shorter `cd-fzf`) searches directory from current and changes location to the selected one. You can add a folder name (or regex) to narrow down the search (it searher recursively).
Exapmle usage: `cd-fzf` or `cd-fzf "go-*"`
